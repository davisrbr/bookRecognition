# bookRecognition
A project with the goal of converting an image of a bookshelf to a list of books.

### Goal
We should be able to easily share our bookshelfs with others. I have gotten a lot out of [Patrick Collison's bookshelf](https://patrickcollison.com/bookshelf) and [other](http://nickcammarata.com/bookshelf) [similar](https://aaronzlewis.com/starterpack/) [bookshelves](https://tomcritchlow.com/wiki/books/bookshelves/). I want to be able to see and be inspired by the books in others' bookshelves! 


For now, this project is composed of 

1. [An initial attempt with traditional computer vision.](https://github.com/davisrbr/bookRecognition/blob/master/notebooks/Traditional_Image_Processing.ipynb)
2. [Experimenting with some optical character recognition systems.](https://github.com/davisrbr/bookRecognition/blob/master/notebooks/OCR_simple.ipynb)
