# bookRecognition
A project with the goal of converting an image of a bookshelf to a list of books.

### Goal
We should be able to easily share our bookshelfs with others. I have gotten a lot out of [Patrick Collison's bookshelf](https://patrickcollison.com/bookshelf) and [other similar bookshelfs](http://nickcammarata.com/bookshelf). I want to be able to see and be inspired by other bookshelves! 


For now, this project is composed of an initial attempt with traditional computer vision in notebooks/Traditional_Image_Processing.ipynb
